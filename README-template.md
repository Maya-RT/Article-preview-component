## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

-JavaScript



### What I learned

Once again what I found most challenging was to make the site responsive specialy using position:absolute; on CSS;. When the desktop page is resize the speech bubble moves away from the share button. I'm not shure how to fix this porblem.
The rest I believe is fine. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.avatar .share:after{
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 50%;
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
    border: 20px solid transparent;
    border-top-color: var(--Very-Dark-Grayish-Blue);
    border-bottom: 0;
    margin-left: -15px;
     margin-bottom: -15px;
    } 
    I've never created an speech bubble before on CSS :`).
```

### Continued development

I've seen many people use CSS grid for this porject. I'm personally not that confortable whith it right now but I would like to work on it.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
